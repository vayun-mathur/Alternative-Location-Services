# Alternative Location Services

This app connects to the [BeaconDB](https://beacondb.net/) public domain wireless geolocation
database to provide network based location services. Unlike standard GPS, this works underground
and inside buildings. Unlike Google's location services, neither this app nor BeaconDB will sell
your location data.

## how to set up
- download apk from releases
- give app location and notification permissions
- enable developer settings
- select this app for the option "select mock location app" within developer settings (it's near the very bottom)
- open the app and it will provide location to all other apps

## Todo:
- bluetooth scanning
- proper user interface
