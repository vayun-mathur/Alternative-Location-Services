# Alternative Location Services

This app connects to the [BeaconDB](https://beacondb.net/) public domain wireless geolocation
database to provide network based location services. Unlike standard GPS, this works underground
and inside buildings. Unlike Google's location services, neither this app nor BeaconDB will sell
your location data.

If you are using this app, consider installing either [NeoStumbler](https://github.com/mjaakko/NeoStumbler) or [Tower Collector](https://github.com/zamojski/TowerCollector)
to contribute to the BeaconDB dataset so you can get a more accurate location from this app.
